# AICTE Internship Project 2: Prediction of Disease Outbreaks

## About
This application utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on patient data. It provides an easy-to-use interface where users can select a disease, input relevant patient details, and receive a prediction.

## Features
- Supports multiple disease predictions
- User-friendly interface
- Machine learning-based prediction
- Explainable AI (XAI) integration for interpretability

## Instructions
1. **Select a disease** from the dropdown menu.
2. **Enter patient information** in the input fields.
3. **Click 'Predict'** to generate a prediction result.
4. The system will analyze the data and provide the likelihood of the selected disease.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, Streamlit, XAI libraries)
- **Machine Learning Models** (trained models for disease prediction)
- **GitHub for version control**
